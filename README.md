# Simple-Hangman-Game

This is my very first programming-based project from university. This has taught me a lot about self-discipline and to be more punctual since my professor at the time used to do regular project check-ups to see how much we have worked in that said week and for that I salute him. 

# But Paul, how can I view your code?

Simple, you enter the 'Hangman' directory. There you will see a file intitulated 'main.cpp'. Go ahead and click that. As for the files, 'cuvinte.txt' is where I store the words that are used for the game that can of course be modified at your leisure, and the 'scor.txt' file is where you save your progress from each game.
